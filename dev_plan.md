# Notification Service Development Plan (FastAPI)

## 1. Project Setup

### 1.1 Environment Setup
- Create a new Python virtual environment
- Install FastAPI, uvicorn, pydantic, and required async libraries

### 1.2 Project Structure
- Create `main.py` as the entry point
- Establish `config.py` for configuration management
- Set up directories: `routers/`, `models/`, `services/`, `tests/`

## 2. Configuration Management

- Implement a Pydantic BaseSettings model for configuration

## 3. API Development

### 3.1 Core Functionality
- Implement POST `/notifications/price-drop` endpoint
- Create Pydantic models for request/response schemas
- Implement async functions for notification processing

### 3.2 Auxiliary Endpoints
- Develop GET `/health` for service health checks
- Implement GET `/metrics` for basic service metrics

## 4. Notification Processing

### 4.1 Queue Management
- Implement an in-memory queue for notification tasks
- Create async worker functions for processing queued notifications

### 4.2 Rate Limiting
- Implement a rate limiter using an in-memory store
- Create utility functions for rate limit checks

## 5. Email Service Integration

- Integrate with an async email service library
- Implement utility functions for email composition and sending
- Create HTML email templates using a templating engine

## 6. Error Handling and Validation

- Implement custom exception classes for specific error scenarios
- Create middleware for global error handling
- Use Pydantic for input validation and error reporting

## 7. Logging and Monitoring

- Set up async logging for all notification attempts
- Implement middleware for request/response logging
- Create utility functions for structured logging

## 8. Testing

### 8.1 Unit Tests
- Write tests for utility functions and helpers
- Implement tests for Pydantic models and validators

### 8.2 Integration Tests
- Test the full notification flow
- Implement tests for rate limiting and queueing logic

### 8.3 Performance Tests
- Use async testing tools to simulate high loads
- Measure and optimize response times and throughput

## 9. Documentation

- Utilize FastAPI's automatic Swagger UI generation
- Add detailed docstrings to all functions and models
- Create a comprehensive README.md with setup and usage instructions

## 10. Optimization and Scalability

- Implement caching strategies for frequent operations
- Use connection pooling for external services
- Optimize Pydantic models for faster serialization/deserialization

## 11. Containerization

- Create a Dockerfile optimized for Python async applications
- Develop a docker-compose.yml for local development and testing

## 12. CI/CD Setup

- Implement GitHub Actions for automated testing and linting
- Set up automated deployment workflows

## 13. Monitoring and Observability

- Integrate with an async-compatible APM tool
- Implement custom metrics for notification success rates and latencies
